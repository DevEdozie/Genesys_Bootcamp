            by 2050." Argues that genetically modified crops are the only way we
            can meet the demand, as we run out of arable lan. Says the GM crops
            are not inherently dangerous because "we've been genetically
            modifying plants and animals for a long time. Long before we calle
            dot science, people were selecting the best breeds"
