    <h1>Ojiakor Michael</h1>

    <p>
      I am a student 400 level student of Electronics and Computer Engineering
      at Nnamdi Azikiwe University Awka, Anambra State. I became interested in
      programming during my first year in the University. I was originally
      offered admission to study Electrical Engineering but during my first
      year, federal universities embarked on a nationwide strike and I spent
      that period at my grandma's place in my hometown. During the course of my
      stay there, I took interest in a particular show which was being aired on
      Nickolodeon, it was titled <b>Game Shakers</b>. It was about a group of
      kids who created video games and sold them to the public, I was really
      fascinated about the coding part of it. I was amazed that someone could
      actually sit down to create awesome stuff from the comfort of their desk
      and also, I felt the art of coding itself was cool.

      I returned to school and continued with my education, I didn't begin
      active coding until after my first year in university, the exams were over
      and I needed something to keep busy with. I picked up programming books
      and started reading them. Luckily enough, we were to offer an
      <b>Introduction to Programming (CSC 201)</b> course the next semester, I
      was lucky to come across the book and I started studying it. It taught
      basic C++ and I studied it while writing the code on paper. My first real
      experience at writing real code was in that same semester, our seniors
      organized a bootcamp to teach us some tech skills. I enrolled for the
      program alongside my friend, I chose the Android development track. We
      were taught the basics of the Java programming language and also of
      Android development. It was my first introduction to programming and I
      found it really difficult though I completed the program succesfully.

      Luckily for me, the Covid-19 pandemic broke out and we were all forced to
      leave the school premises, I returned to my home town and this time I
      downloaded a book called <b>Java for Dummies</b> which I used to learn the
      fundamentals of programming alongside a Java IDE I downloaded on my mobile
      phone. I later got a laptop and continued my development. I built some
      apps which i did not publish on the playstore. I continued moving at my
      pace until I applied for
      <b>Google Africa Devloper Scholarship Program 2022</b>. I enrolled in the
      <b>Android Development Track</b> and I was taught Android development
      properly. The program ran for 6 months, I completed it and got the
      certificate of participation.
    </p>

      After completing the program, I tried looking for jobs but could not find
      any available roles. I finally found one as a Front end Developer intern
      at <b>Mactavis Digital</b> a digital solution company in Lagos. I had to accept the role as I needed a company to perform my Industrial training for my 400 level internship period. As they say, <b>no knowledge is a waste</b>, I am currently enrolled in this program to improve my front end development skills and gain the best out of it.
